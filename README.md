# PRODIGY_SD_02
The Guessing Game Program is an interactive Python script designed to challenge users to guess a randomly generated number. The program provides feedback on whether the user's guess is too high or too low and continues to prompt the user until they guess the correct number. It then displays the total number of attempts taken to guess the number correctly. This game is a fun way to practice programming logic and user interaction in Python.

## Features
- Random Number Generation: The program generates a random number between 1 and 100 for the user to guess.
- User Interaction: Prompts the user to input their guess and provides feedback on whether the guess is too high or too low.
- Attempts Counter: Tracks and displays the number of attempts the user has made to guess the correct number.
- Input Validation: Ensures the user inputs a valid integer, prompting them to try again if they don't.
